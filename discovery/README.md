There's a lot of crap in the filenames you get by the lsof of the Notes processes, both in sqlite temporary files and other shit. So I put a bunch of stuff into an inclusion list (it's in `notes-grep-exclude.txt`- hopefully i'm not filtering out anything important)

And then grepped them:
```
5677 â—¯  {lsof -p 966; lsof -p 1008} | grep -v -f notes-grep-exclude.txt | awk '{ $1=$2=""; $3=$4=""; $5=$6=""; $7=$8="" ; print $0}' | cut -d ' ' -f 9-
~/Library/Containers/com.apple.Notes.datastore/Data
/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/NotesShared.framework/Versions/A/XPCServices/com.apple.Notes.datastore.xpc/Contents/MacOS/com.apple.Notes.datastore
~/Library/Group Containers/group.com.apple.notes/NoteStore.sqlite
~/Library/Group Containers/group.com.apple.notes/NoteStore.sqlite
~/Library/Containers/com.apple.Notes/Data
/Applications/Notes.app/Contents/MacOS/Notes
~/Library/Containers/com.apple.Notes/Data/Library/Notes/NotesV7.storedata
```

(that command string was tough to iterate, i ended up making a poor-coders-watch with `while true; do clear; that-command | and | shit; sleep 2; dnone`)

So these files 
* `~/Library/Containers/com.apple.Notes.datastore/Data` is an empty directory structure. Symlinks are probably just to get config files and shit from outside the sandbox.\*
* `/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/NotesShared.framework/Versions/A/XPCServices/com.apple.Notes.datastore.xpc/Contents/MacOS/com.apple.Notes.datastore` is an executable and seems to be what persists data to iCloud and local storage.
* ~/Library/Containers/com.apple.Notes/Data has a lot of stuff, it's all of my shit. Going through this directory structure\* it looks like apart from all my uploaded file blobs there's also a lot of other metadata stuff.

Lets put this whole discussion in a separate file, [databases.md]



Those are all the SQL dbs and these are all the rest:

```~/Library/Containers/com.apple.Notes/Data/Library/Preferences/com.xerox.xeroxfeatures.pde.plist:          XML 1.0 document text, ASCII text

```

* `xeroxfeatures` is empty and probably there to enable some sort of printing
* `A17F49D....plist` is a binary plist, and just has a uuid in it
* the next `SharingExtension` version of it is the same thing with a diff UUID
* The following one is the `com.apple.Notes.plist` file which has a lot of config in it. i probably dont really care abt the rest. it has some keys like `ArchivedUIState` which tells you about expanded folders... DidChooseToMigrateLocalAccount, DidMigrateLocalAccount, NotesIndexerState-HTML (and -Modern). Some Split view subview frames named here. some timestamps for logging references and state stuff for CloudKit. this checks if everything's been synced
I converted this with `plutil -p ~/Library/Containers/com.apple.Notes/Data/Library/Preferences/com.apple.Notes.plist > com.apple.Notes.plist.readable` and committed the file here. 
* the `Cookies.binarycookies` file has some twitter data in it...? Not super relevant anyways
* `1AFC6CE5` appears to be a CSS file for recaptcha?
* RemoteConfiguration has some stuff with max attachment sizes and sub attachments and local throttling policy




\* (Disclaimer i have no fuckin clue how  apple sandboxing works). I ran thru these files by doing `find $1 | xargs file | egrep -v 'directory$' | egrep -v "broken sym" | egrep -v "No such"` but the broken symlinks are probably where it gets the important stuff.
