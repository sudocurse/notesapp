There's a lot of crap in the filenames you get by the lsof of the Notes processes, both in sqlite temporary files and other shit. So I put a bunch of stuff into an inclusion list (it's in `notes-grep-exclude.txt`- hopefully i'm not filtering out anything important)

And then grepped them:
```
5677 â—¯  {lsof -p 966; lsof -p 1008} | grep -v -f notes-grep-exclude.txt | awk '{ $1=$2=""; $3=$4=""; $5=$6=""; $7=$8="" ; print $0}' | cut -d ' ' -f 9-

/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/NotesShared.framework/Versions/A/XPCServices/com.apple.Notes.datastore.xpc/Contents/MacOS/com.apple.Notes.datastore

/Applications/Notes.app/Contents/MacOS/Notes
/Users/apresswa/Library/Containers/com.apple.Notes/Data/Library/Notes/NotesV7.storedata
```

(that command string was tough to iterate, i ended up making a poor-coders-watch with `while true; do clear; that-command | and | shit; sleep 2; dnone`)

So these files 
* `/Users/apresswa/Library/Containers/com.apple.Notes.datastore/Data` is an empty directory structure. Symlinks are probably just to get config files and shit from outside the sandbox.\*
* `/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/NotesShared.framework/Versions/A/XPCServices/com.apple.Notes.datastore.xpc/Contents/MacOS/com.apple.Notes.datastore` is an executable and seems to be what persists data to iCloud and local storage.
* /Users/apresswa/Library/Containers/com.apple.Notes/Data has a lot of stuff, it's all of my shit. Going through this directory structure\* it looks like apart from all my uploaded file blobs there's also a lot of other metadata stuff.

\* (Disclaimer i have no fuckin clue how  apple sandboxing works). I ran thru these files by doing `find $1 | xargs file | egrep -v 'directory$' | egrep -v "broken sym" | egrep -v "No such"` but the broken symlinks are probably where it gets the important stuff.
