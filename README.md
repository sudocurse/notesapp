There's a lot of crap in the filenames you get by the lsof of the Notes processes, both in sqlite temporary files and other shit. So I put a bunch of stuff into an inclusion list (it's in `notes-grep-exclude.txt`- hopefully i'm not filtering out anything important)

And then grepped them:
```
5677 â—¯  {lsof -p 966; lsof -p 1008} | grep -v -f notes-grep-exclude.txt | awk '{ $1=$2=""; $3=$4=""; $5=$6=""; $7=$8="" ; print $0}' | cut -d ' ' -f 9-
